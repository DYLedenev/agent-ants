    "task": "First, I need to break this down. The first part is planning and summarizing the report. That could involve researching current AI applications in healthcare. So the first subtask might be gathering information on AI applications. But maybe the user wants the first subtask to be the planning phase. Wait, the task says \"plan and summarize,\" so maybe the first subtask is to outline the report structure and identify key areas. But the user wants actionable subtasks, so maybe the first is to research current AI uses in healthcare. Then the next step is to summarize the findings. But the user wants three subtasks. Wait, the original task is to plan and summarize the report, then extract risks and suggest mitigations. So maybe split into three parts: 1) Research AI applications in healthcare, 2) Summarize the key points, 3) Identify risks and mitigation strategies. But the user might want the subtasks to be more specific. Let me check the example response. The example has three subtasks: 1. Research AI applications in healthcare. 2. Summarize key uses, trends, and benefits. 3. Identify risks and propose mitigation strategies. That makes sense. So the user wants three clear, actionable steps without explanations. Each subtask should be a single line. So I need to make sure each subtask is concise and covers a distinct part of the original task. Let me verify again. The original task is to plan and summarize a mini report on AI in healthcare, then extract risks and suggest mitigations. So splitting into three parts: research the applications, summarize, and then analyze risks and mitigation. That works. So the three subtasks are as the example shows. I think that's correct.",

Let me think: maybe the first subtask is to gather information on AI applications in healthcare. Then, the second could be to summarize the findings into a concise report. The third would be to analyze risks and propose mitigation strategies. That makes sense. Each subtask is a distinct phase: research, summarize, and risk mitigation. I need to make sure each is a single line and actionable. Let me check if there's any overlap or if I missed something. Yeah, that covers all parts of the original task without exceeding three subtasks. Alright, that should work.",

Let me think. Maybe the first subtask is planning and researching the report. Then the second would be summarizing the findings. The third would be extracting risks and mitigation strategies. Wait, but the original task mentions both extracting risks and suggesting mitigations. So maybe the third subtask combines those two parts. Let me check the example response. Oh right, the example has three subtasks: 1. Plan and research AI healthcare applications, 2. Summarize key points and trends, 3. Extract risks and propose mitigation strategies. That makes sense. I need to make sure each subtask is actionable and concise. No fluff, just the tasks. So the user probably needs a clear, step-by-step plan without any extra explanations. They might be a student or a professional needing to structure their work efficiently. They want to ensure they cover all parts of the original task but in a streamlined way. Let me verify if splitting into three is sufficient. Yes, each subtask handles a distinct part of the process. Alright, that should work.",
