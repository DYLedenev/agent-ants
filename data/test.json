    "task": "What is AGI?",
    "response": "AGI stands for **Artificial General Intelligence**, a hypothetical form of artificial intelligence that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across any intellectual task a human can perform. Unlike narrow AI (e.g., apps like Siri or recommendation systems), which is specialized for specific tasks, AGI would have **general cognitive abilities**, including reasoning, problem-solving, creativity, and self-awareness. \n\nCurrently, AGI remains **theoretical** and is a major goal in AI research. Its development raises significant ethical, philosophical, and technical questions about the future of intelligence and humanity."
